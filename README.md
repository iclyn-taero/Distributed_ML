# Distributed_ML

## Main Purpose:
To create a LLM model that distributes the workload between two computers to learn more about data parallel distribution. 

## Reason: 
I want to learn more about how to train huge llm model's and how to do it efficiently. Once the model is done, I hope to deploy and run the model on a website
